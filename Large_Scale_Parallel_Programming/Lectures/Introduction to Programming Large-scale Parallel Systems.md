# What is Parallel Programming?
In contrast to [sequential programming](Sequential%20Programming) [parallel programming](Parallel%20Programming) uses multiple threads of control.
Because of this these programs can handle multiple activities at the same time.

In the current day a lot of systems handle parallel processes. These parallel processes are crucial for [high-performance computing](High-Performance%20Computing).
# Why do we need Parallel Programming?
In some fields a lot of data needs to be collected or analysed. For this to work you are required to have a lot of computing power to handle all this data. Parallel computing is then you to efficiently distribute all the calculations over the different systems.

Sequential cores also have reached their speed limits because no additional transistors can be added to the core's.
Because of this some proclaim that [[Moore's Law]] is dead because of that.

# Different type of computing
## [Cluster computing](Cluster%20&%20Grid%20Computing)
Combination of multiple clusters together (local and homogenous)
They are used as a unified computing resource
## [Grid computing](Cluster%20&%20Grid%20Computing)
A network of machines working together to perform a task. Can have different hardware configurations.
## [Multicores](Multi-core%20Processor)
A microprocessor on a single [integrated circuit](Integrated%20Circuit) with two or more CPU's connected via a bus.
Is limited by the bus band width.
