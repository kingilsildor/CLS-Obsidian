# Complex system
Hard to reason about [complex systems](Complex%20Systems) without using computing as a way to model.
When modelling a complex systems you look at the interactive parts within the system.
You can't just study a traffic jam by observing a single driver.
Through interactions of individuals new structures arise.
These systems have hard to predict phenomena based on small changes
Cause -> effect is hard to understand.

# [[Agent Based Modelling]]
Simple systems to measure segregation used in Schelling's Model of Segregation

## Classification of Infectious Diseases

| Pathogens | Example                     | Explanation                                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Micro     | Bacteria / viruses / prions | Fast developments, only the host's infection  status is important |
| Macro     | Parasitic worms             | Complex life cycle                                                |


| Transmissons |     |                     |
| ------------ | --- | ------------------- |
| Direct       |     | Via close contact   |
|              |     | Via a vector        |
| Indirect     |     | Via the environment |
|              |     | Via air             |
A vector is technically indirect , but within modelling we assume that it's a direct form

## Characterizing Disease Spread

| Verb                                     | Definition                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Communicable disease                     | A disease that spreads                                          |
| Infection                                | The entry and development/multiplication of an infectious agent |
| Vector of Infection                      | A living carrier that transports the infectious agent           |
| [Endemic](Epidemiology)                  | The usual or expected frequency of disease                      |
| [Epidemic](Epidemiology)                 | The excess of expected occurrences                              |
| [Pandemic](Epidemiology)                 | The collection of epidemic's over a wide geographic area        |
| Susceptible                              | Uninfected, but able to become infected                         |
| Infectious                               | Infected and able to transmit to other susceptible agents       |
| Immune                                   | Protection against an infection                                 |
| Diseased/clinical infection              | Symptomatic Infected                                            |
| Latent infection / subclinical infection | Asymptomatic Infected                                           |

Endemic:
- Transmission occur, but the number of cases remains constant
Epidemic:
- The number of cases increases
Pandemic:
- When epidemics occur at several continents


A disease spreads in "waves", $\text{P}_0$ infects $\text{R}_0$ many people whereby $\text{R}_0$ is the basic reproductive number
If $\text{R}_0 > 1$ the disease spreads

# [[Spreading Phenomenon]]
The phenomenon where information spreads through a [system](System)/[network](Network) and where the spreading leads to local information processing.
Spreading of information in the broad sense is a very
common phenomenon

Not only diseases can spread but also rumours, tweets or fires.
