# Spatial Models
Because transmission is a local process, it can happen that different area's will have a different spreading rate. This is partly because population is not evenly spread. Cities will have more people in it than the countryside and people move around from area to area.

Spatial models give the opportunity to capture spatial components of a system.
They can:
- determine the rate of spatial spread
- Understand influence of heterogeneity of population densities
- Understand how to use spatial models to optimize control measures

Spatial models can be made in multiple abstractions:

**Patch:**
- All members of the same patch (town, city) will have the same force of infection
**Distance:**
