# General Information
## Aim
The aim of this course is to provide an overview of Computational Science and modelling techniques available to the Computational Scientist. We will do this by consideringÂ one specific application (spreading of infectious diseases) and formulating different types of models and simulations, thus not only exploring the rich set of modellingÂ paradigms available to us, but also diving deep in the specific application field. You will also be exposed to recent research results from the Computational Science Lab, to see other examples of Computational Science in action.

## Contents
Modelling and Simulation, spreading of infectious disease, SIR model and variants, ODE, PDE, CAs, Networks, ABM.Â Â Acquired knowledge will be applied in in a number of lab assignments, covering the whole chain from model description and simulation, Â model verification and validation, toÂ data gathering and analysis .

## Format
In the course we try to mimic in some way a real research environment. So, you will receive scattered information (book chapters, research papers, notes and slides) and you should organiseÂ all this yourself to create a deep understanding of the topics that are discussed. We strongly advise you to keep a labbook/diary for the course (using your own favourite tool) and to write yourself lecture notes to help organising the knowledge. This is important for the learning/research process, as this is what you will be doing much more in the Master, and certainly during the projects and your final Ma thesis research. But it is also important when you prepare for the exam.  

During 7 weeks there will be two lectures per week, two lab sessions per week (one supervised, with teaching assistants available and one unsupervised, basically the room is available for you so that you have a space to collaborate, if needed). You will write reports for the lab assignments, and you will have a final exam in the 8th week of the course.

## Book
A large part of the content of this course is inspired by the book "ModelingÂ Infectious Diseases in Humans and Animals" by Matt Keeling and PejmanÂ Rohani. To follow the course and do the exam, it is not strictly needed to buy this book. However, if you find this topic interesting and want to go a bit deeper and see many very good examples, you are strongly advised to buy the book.

The book is accompaniedÂ by aÂ website, where you can find code snippets (o.a. in Python) of many of the models that are discussed in the book and also in the course. Take your advantage of this. But as always, if you do so, mention this in your report, and in your own code, clearly disclose the source of some of the code. As in scientific papers, also in scientific software we want to give complete credit to colleaguesÂ whose work we are using for our own research.
