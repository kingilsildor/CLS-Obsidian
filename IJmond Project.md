A lot of the participants were familiar with organisations related to air quality.
Things like:
- GGD
- RIVM
- Luchtmeetnet
- Scapeler that scrapes data from Luchtmeetnet

They see that these different organisations and the tools can help with starting conversations with the stakeholders Tata steel and the [Omgeving Dienst](https://www.odijmond.nl/)(OD). The vibe about this was tens/irritated. Some participants mentioned they distrust OD.  
> "The time to talk with these stakeholders is over."

The participants have especially difficult with OD because of all there cancelations and difficulty with sending data. The data needs to specifically formatted such that the file size is not the big and in mp4 form without special characters. Besides that it can't be a link or a GIF with time jumps in it. The time of the feedback is really important for this as well as the quality of the footage.
One of the participants showed pictures about some pollution on his phone he made himself.

Some of the participants uses different AI tools, such as LLM (ChatGPT). They even had the apps installed on their phone.


When the breathecam tool was shown some participants were sceptical about the tool. Especially related to the amount of time it will take to analyse all the data. But they mentioned that it was a good step to increase the involvement of the locals. Different feedback was given about the tool as mentioned on the post-its like a way to download the video instead of an url.
Some of the participants found it difficult to understand that the video at breathecam couldn't be moved or that not all ovens were shown. This was because the camera had a fixed point.


The groups gave a lot of feedback related to the AI tooling. They were a lot more critical about this. The assumption is that this is because they don't understand how it works. Some of the participants found the bbox difficult to understand. The participants also would prefer a video instead of img and want to incorporate the application with other webpages.
They were a bit laughing to them self about how to differentiate smoke from smog. They mentioned that depending on the light smoke can look light or dark. They wanted to know how you would teach people to differentiate smoke from smog. A tutorial would help with this issue.
> "How do you learn people to differentiate smoke from not smoke?"

One of the participants next to the Tata steel guy didn't really participate with the AI assignment. He gave the feeling that he knew better.

All of the participants agree that the AI tool needs a way to validate. They are afraid that organizations such as Tata steel want to meddle with the data/labelling. For example a login or people who are experienced with labelling as a gold standard. The participants were also curious about how many people are labelling the data. Some mentioned to use software such as Mechanical Turk.
The participants want to use the tool to find relations between different emissions like statistics about different kind of emissions clouds sorted by colour. They are also curious how the AI can differentiate between licensed emissions, because one would expect smoke coming from the chimneys. As another participant from Frissewind mentioned that even from chimneys illegal smoke can me emitted.  Licensed emissions are build in different ways so that it can be difficult to probably label an emission. The participants mentioned that stakeholder did this on purpose. 

Some of the participants were familiar with the Pittsburgh smell application and really would like a big data solution related to IJmond. An application were someone can submits the smell in an area an how the different clouds look like. They also are curious how different air currents are influencing these parameters.
Some of the participants want to implement an AI solution to different topics within the province of Noord-Holland. such as detecting wood buring.


Question 6 should be explained a bit more. Perhaps even question 7. Some participants didn't really know what kind of workshop was meant by the question. One of the participants looked critical and negative about the workshop asked how other people find the workshop. The other participants were quite positive, but mentioned that this is only the first step. \
> "Why add all of these extra things, let them first fixed the basics"

Some lady was expecting more unrest because of the loaded title toxic clouds but was happily surprised.
